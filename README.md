# wrapify

**wrapify** is a Go library designed to simplify and standardize API response wrapping for RESTful services. It leverages the Decorator Pattern to dynamically add error handling, metadata, pagination, and other response features in a clean and human-readable format. With Wrapify, you can ensure consistent and extensible API responses with minimal boilerplate. Perfect for building robust, maintainable REST APIs in Go!

### Requirements

- Go version 1.23 or higher

### Installation

To install, you can use the following commands based on your preference:

- For a specific version:

  ```bash
  go get github.com/sivaosorg/wrapify@v0.0.1
  ```

- For the latest version:
  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/sivaosorg/wrapify@latest
  ```

### Getting started

#### Getting wrapify

With [Go's module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```go
import "github.com/sivaosorg/wrapify"
```

#### Usage

> An example of the wrapper-based standardized API response

```json
{
  "data": "response body here", // The primary data payload of the response.
  "debug": {
    "___abc": "trace sessions_id: 4919e84fc26881e9fe790f5d07465db4",
    "refer": 1234
  }, // Debugging information (useful for development).
  "message": "How are you? I'm good", // A message providing additional context about the response.
  "meta": {
    "api_version": "v0.0.1", // API version used for the request.
    "custom_fields": {
      "fields": "userID: 103"
    }, // Additional custom metadata fields.
    "locale": "en_US", // Locale used for the request, e.g., "en-US".
    "request_id": "80eafc6a1655ec5a06595d155f1e6951", // Unique identifier for the request, useful for debugging.
    "requested_time": "2024-12-14T20:24:23.983839+07:00" // Timestamp when the request was made.
  }, // Metadata about the API response.
  "pagination": {
    "is_last": true, // Indicates whether this is the last page.
    "page": 1000, // Current page number.
    "per_page": 2, // Number of items per page.
    "total_items": 120, // Total number of items available.
    "total_pages": 34 // Total number of pages.
  }, // Pagination details, if applicable.
  "path": "/api/v1/users", // Request path for which the response is generated.
  "status_code": 200, // HTTP status code for the response.
  "total": 1 // Total number of items (used in non-paginated responses).
}
```
